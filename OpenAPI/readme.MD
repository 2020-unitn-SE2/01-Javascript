# OpenAPI Specification
Taken from (https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)

OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs. An OpenAPI file allows you to describe your entire API, including:

- Available endpoints (/users) and operations on each endpoint (GET /users, POST /users)
- Operation parameters Input and output for each operation
- Authentication methods
- Contact information, license, terms of use and other information.

API specifications can be written in YAML or JSON. The format is easy to learn and readable to both humans and machines. The complete OpenAPI Specification can be found on GitHub:
